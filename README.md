****Objective of this project is to build an online platform (application) for 
students and faculty of the college.****
1) A streamlined platform to roll out important announcements.
2) Platform to receive department specific notices only.
3) To be able to remain aware of the activities of various clubs taking 
place in the college.
4) A better way for class coordinators to communicate with the class.
5) Students receive important information in an orderly fashion with 
fewer cases of overlooked information.

**motivation** behind this project came from the issues faced by the 
class representatives and the faculty of our own college in circulating important 
information among the students of our own college. At times the important 
notices to be circulated among students get lost in the chaos of social media 
platforms being used as the means of communication. Some information gets 
overlooked by students, other does not reach the students at the appropriate 
time causing a substantial hindrance in the academic activities.
Hence, we thought of building an application which will make delivering and 
receiving information related to college activities streamlined and in a proper 
format.
